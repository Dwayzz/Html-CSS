                    If interested in a specific pet please reach out to us about that pet. Once the  adoption process gets going we require a mandatory interview with our adoption representative. 
                    Once you have gone through the interview we will then invite you to a meet and greet for a final time with your pet. Finalizing the adoption takes 24-48 to fill all paperwork.

    <h3>    
        Our registration only consists of a short interview to determine if you will qualify or not. Our adoption fee is $200 which covers shots.
        All dogs are fed with different types of dog food so please make sure you look under the food category on your papers to feed your dog the right food.
